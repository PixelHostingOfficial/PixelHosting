## What is PixelHosting all about?
PixelHosting is an upcoming budget hosting service exclusively for Minecraft Servers. Run by a dedicated team of two individuals, we are committed to bringing the best price-to-performance in the hosting industry. We prioritize customer satisfaction above all else and are completely transparent.

## Why we're the best choice
We hate expensive hosting services just the same as you, which is why we created PixelHosting. Why pay stupidly high prices, like $5 per GB per month, when you can get similar specifications for more than half the cost?

## We share information!
Transparency is our core value, and we maintain complete openness by publicly sharing our financial information, hosting providers, and other company-related details for our clients to access.
